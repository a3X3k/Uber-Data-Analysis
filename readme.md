## About

- All of us at some point in our life have used uber, so here we will be doing the exploratory analysis of uber pickups. Which will help us better analyze the business. 
- Data analysis helps travel organizations to provide better recommendations for investing in their future trips based on its business and personal trips. 
-	With increasing amounts of urban data being collected and made available, new possibilities of data-driven research emerge lead to changes in people living through scientific proof-based decision-making and strategies. 
- Here we concentrate on an urban data set of particular significance which is taxi rides. 
- Taxis are essential, and taxi-related information can provide ground-breaking insight into different facets of city life, from economic activity and human behavior to mobility trends.  Taxi data involves geographical components as well as several variables associated with each ride. 
- Data insight is gain through data pre-processing, feature engineering and data exploratory analysis. This transformation of raw data will enable us to have the meaningful insight into the data and understand the mobility pattern of New York City. 
- The primary methodology behind this study is to analyze and find the accuracy of the most frequent category of trip among all trips taken by a customer in a region using data analysis. 
- Uber Data Analysis task permits us to recognize the complicated factual visualization of this large organization. 
- We will be using ‘Python’ programming language. Here we analyze the Daily, Monthly and Yearly Uber Pickups in New York City. This mission is primarily based on Data Visualization that will give us information towards use of ggplot2 library for perception of the data. There are many questions that can be answered but here we will be focusing on,
