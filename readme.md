## Introduction



<br/>

## Motivation and Objectives

 - According to the United Nations in 2008, for the first time in history, half of the world’s population was living in urban areas (United Nations, 2008). 
- In 1950 there were only two metropolises with at least 10 million inhabitants. In 1975 only three metropolises broke that barrier. Today there are 21 megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants, and in 2025, the United Nations estimates that there will be 27 cities (United Nations, 2012). This is clear evidence of the fast growth of urbanization in terms of population and size. The demand for better services (e.g. public transportation, energy, communications) and urban planning (e.g. infrastructures, environments, policies) increases with the rapid growth of urban areas. In order to maintain a constant flow of people and vehicles, we need to reduce the use of individual means of transport (e.g. car) and stimulate the use of public transportation (e.g. bus, metro, train). Traffic is one of the major sources of toxic compounds present in combustion gases that 
negatively impact the health of urban inhabitants (EEA, 2011), (Borrego, et al., 2000), (Zavala, et al., 2006), (Ndoke & Jimoh, 2005), (Becker, et al., 2000). 
- There is a need to address this issue today while low-carbon transport systems are still being developed. However, we need to improve the public transportation system in order to meet citizens’ needs. A more efficient public transportation system can lead to a reduction in traffic congestions and consequent reduction of energy consumption and pollution. Nevertheless, to optimize the public transportation network it is essential to understand what drives the common citizen and what their needs are. We need a better understanding of city dynamics. Gathering data from the traditional public transportation (e.g. bus, train, metro) can provide us with a relevant database and information on general passengers’ movement. However, it does not provide the exact origin and destination for each passenger, since these transportation modes rely on pre-designated stops and paths. The taxi can be a way to retrieve a large data set of information with higher precision when we focus on the origin and destination of each trip. 
- Taxis can pick-up the passengers right where they are standing, and drop them off precisely at their desirable destination, without being bound to a pre-determined path. 
- The process of data collecting is transparent and non-intrusive to the passenger.
- Additionally, taxis can be used as a probe for traffic conditions (Castro, et al., 2012), (Yuan, et al., 2011a), (Gühnemann, et al., 2004), (Liu, et al., 2009a).
- At the same time, we are experiencing new developments in pervasive and ubiquitous computing technologies, such as a global system for mobile communications (GSM) and a global positioning system (GPS), which provide useful tools for sensing social and traffic activities in cities. 
- Nowadays we are able to access a wider variety of devices, with a growing number of features and computational capabilities. 
- This technological diversity provides us with the tools to sense urban spaces. 
- It allows us to either take a collective snapshot of all urban activity or simply follow the pattern of a single vehicle or individual. Analyzing GPS-enabled vehicle traces and mobile phone activity thus provides, to some extent, an overview of how the city functions. 
- Taxis are currently equipped with GPS devices for better monitoring and dispatching. 
- Their traces have been used to study various aspects of the traffic network as they provide fine-grained data that reflects the state of traffic flow in a city. 
- These traces typically carry occupancy information on pick-up and drop-off location. 
- The ubiquity of taxis has attracted considerable attention for a while, in order to extract information and develop prediction systems, which led to a significant amount 
of research work being performed around the exploration of taxi-GPS traces. 
- Facing the challenges of growing cities and by taking the opportunistic sensing approach, a main question is posed: to what extent can GPS traces of taxis be used to infer the city’s dynamics, namely the inhabitants’ patterns? Furthermore, what is the role of taxis in the complex relations amid the diversity of urban data sources? 
- Although previous research on this topic led to important findings, there are still challenges yet to explore that we aim to analyze in this thesis. 
- Our work deepens the spatiotemporal analysis and the study of predictability of taxi trips by using complementary data (e.g. Points Of Interest, weather conditions); explores the underlining relationship between taxi volume and mobile phone activity, two important urban data sources; and further extends the study of the relation among urban data sources by examining the relationship between taxi mobility patterns, weather conditions and the level of concentration of exhaust gases, to estimate the concentrations of gas in urban areas.
